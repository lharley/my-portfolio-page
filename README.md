# my-portfolio-page
Simple, one page portfolio website to showcase my UX design and Web development

The GitHub source contains the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, fonts, and image files for my portfolio page. However, the GitHub source does NOT contain the UX design files and working prototypes. I have put the code on GitHub to facilitate reviewing the first level files.

To view my UX Design and Front-end Development portfolio, and to view all the example, see http://www.di-projects.com/projArea32.
