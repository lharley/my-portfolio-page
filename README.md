# my-portfolio-page
Simple, one page portfolio website to showcase my UX design and Web development

The GitHub source contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for my portfolio page. However, the GitHub source does NOT contain the fonts, images, demo, files, and working prototypes. I have put the code on GitHub to facilitate reviewing my HTML coding. 

To view my UX Design and Front-end Development portfolio, and to view the examples and working prototypes, see http://www.di-projects.com/projArea32.
