# my-portfolio-page
Simple, one page portfolio website to showcase my UX design and Web development

The GitHub source contains the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, fonts, and image files for my portfolio page. However, the GitHub source does NOT contain the UX design files and working prototypes. So you cannot download the GitHub soure and recreate my portfolio. If you click to view the full storyboards or access a working prototype, you will get an alert "Not functional" or a 404 Error (file not found). I am not using GitHub a source control or backup repository for my portfolio. I have put the source code on GitHub to facilitate reviewing the simple one page code.
