# my-portfolio-page
Simple, one page portfolio website to showcase my UX design and Web development

The GitHub source contains the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, fonts, and image files for my portfolio page. However, the GitHub source does NOT contain the UX design files and working prototypes. Unfortunately, you cannot download the GitHub source and recreate my portfolio. I am not using GitHub for source control of my portfolio. I have put the code on GitHub to facilitate reviewing the first level files.
