            <h3>Project Background and Context</h3>
            <p>MorphoTrust's business model -- it's technology and identity services --
                was extremely complex. The company combined technically
                specialized SLR cameras, fingerprint scanners,
                voice recording devices, and retina and voice scanners
                with custom device drivers. It then combined the
                devices into application software for identity application
                processing, authentication and verification -- facial
                recognition, fingerprint matching, iris and voice recognition.
                MorphoTrust was also a trusted partner of federal and state governments
                and used government databases, such as the FBI criminal database,
                to do background checks on applicants for identity credentials.
                MorphoTrust also produced identity credentials at 6 plants located
                throughout the U.S. These credentials were produced to
                exacting standards of the U.S. government. The company's
                clients were police departments, state DMVs,  the U.S.
                State Department, the FAA, banks, airports and security companies.</p>

                    verified that security features were present. The
                    prototype was used during application development.
                    Built into the software were network facilities
                   for communicating with federal and state databases
                    to see if the identity on the license had outstanding
                    criminal or other security issues.</p>

            <p>Each of MorphoTrust's client agencies were
                sold a different customized variation of
                "the product,' so that by 2013, MorphoTrust was
                maintaining over 50  product installations.
                Company leadership wanted to combine all the custom
                installations into a real product, with a single
                platform based on a modern UI and a backend based on modern
                coding practices -- flexible and scalable architecture, resuable
                components, Restful APIs, JavaSript frameworks, .etc. </p>

            <h3>Personas and Legacy System Documentation</h3>
            <p>The MorphoTrust product redesign was begun by traditional
                business analysts (BAs), technical writers, and the development
                team. Our UX team was created when management found
                that protential customers were disatisfied with the initial
                design concepts. Our UX team was established
                to address the usability issues, non-modern UI look and feel,
                and lack of technical innovations in the redesign. The Director
                of UX was hired, then I was the second person hired
                and became the UX Lead. The team was eventually built out to 8 team members.
            </p>

            <h3>Issues with User Research and Personas</h3>
            <p>When the UX team started our work, we inherited user research and traditional
                use cases created by BAs.</p>
        </div>
        <aside class="sidebarComments">
            <div>
                <p>The Credential Examiner was the key user of
                the system in the BAs documentation. This role
                had the most complicated set of task flows,
                since there were different types of identity credentials to process.
                In  DMV agencies, for instance, there could be
                as many as 22 different types of licenses, such as
                Commercial Driver License, which had numerous federal
                and state laws that had to be satisfied before a license could be issued. </p>
            </div>
        </aside>
        <div class="article">
                <img class="article" src="images/Credential_Examiner_old.png">
                <p>We assumed that the persona information was sound, because they
                looked very detailed. As we began our UX design activities,
                    however, we found inconsitencies and gaps. The original persona had a very
                    simple job goal -- to help the applicant. And the persona
                    had only two main psychological attributes -- high engergy
                    and the lack of knowledge about computers. A number of
                    the pain points for this persona involved
                    the lack of devices or devices that ran slow, which were not
                    easy to remedy though software. The persona
                    did not have a clear motivation or focus around which
                    to innovate system features. I didn't expect the BAs to
                    write UX-like scenarios, but the use cases and task flows
                    were very complicated and did not coordinate very
                    well with the simple persona.
            </p>
            <p>
                I met with the buisness analysts and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).
                The SMEs explained that they had all worked at state and
                federal agencies. They had used themselves and their
                knowledge of staff for the personas. No actual ethnographic
                research had been done and no quantitative data had
                been collected from multiple users. Most important
                for me, no persona scenarios had been developed, so
                the personas lacked clear task focus in the context
                of the proposed new software features. Without the scenarios,
                it was hard to envision how the proposed new system improved
                the existing system.

            <h3>Limited Ethnographic and Quantitative Research</h3>

            <p> Because of time constraints and the reluctance of leadership to
                revisit work they felt was already completed, we were limited
                in what we could do to remedy the lack of good personas.
                However, after presentations to the project manager and
                other stackholders, we persuaded leadership to allow members
                of the UX team to talk with and observe real end users as
                part of our periodic site visits to present design concepts.</p>
            </p>
            <p>While our ethnogrphic research was limited, is was extremely
                insightful and helped us write better personas. It also helped
                us find real user pain points, where we could propose innovations.
                After analyzing the ethnographic research we began an
                update of the original personas. In talking with Examiners
                and their supervisor, the Examiner Lead, we learned the
                complexities of identity rules and agency task flows
                from the end users' point of view. It wasn't just
                that  Examiners lacked  computer knowledge, which
                was mentioned by the original personas. They
                also lacked knowledge of government
                identity laws and weren't always sure of agency policies.
                A number of examiners said when they were unsure, they
                went to their co-workers who had more knowlege. It
                was important to the examiners to help each other. They
                all reported that it took lots of training and 4-5 years of
                service before they felt comfortable with all the details
                of the work.</p>

                <p>After analyzing the ethnographic research we began an
                    update of the original personas. The redefined Credential
                    Examiner is shown. We found attributes and motivations
                    that the original peronas did not list. These helped
                    us see ways to innovate the system.</p>
            </div>
        </aside>
        <div class="article">

            <img class="article" src="images/Ellana_Identity_Examiner.png">

            <p>We found it surprising that none of the Examiners
                talked about the wait time for applicants or their
                goal of helping applicants. (The stakeholders
                of the agency, on the other had, were concerned about
                applicant wait time and customer service.) What
                the Examiners talked about was the complexities
                of the different task flows and the
                need to avoid mistakes or they would get into trouble.
                One Examiner said she was worried she might lose her
                job, if she got another bad report. Another
                Examiner reported that the malfunctioning
                scanner caused her to produce poor scans, for which
                she was reprimanded as a mistake. The concern over
                mistakes was echoed by the Examiner Lead.
                It is no wonder agencies have a reputation for slow
                processing times and poor customer service. Examiners
                are judged on their accuracy to adhere to agency
                policies. They are  not judged on how many
                applications they process or how fast.

                <h3>Additional Personas</h3>
                <p>The personas for the MorphoTrust product turned out to be
                    yet more extensive. The BAs had originally identified
                    the main user as the Credential Examiner who used the software
                    to process identity credentials. This had always been
                    the focus of MorphoTrust software, so it was natural
                    that the BAs focused there. But  there was another
                    key user, the applicant, which they mentioned
                    in some use cases. But a persona was not developed.</p>

                <p>After our discussions with agency supervisor staff
                    on site, it became clear that a major pain point
                    for agency stakeholders was satisfying applicant needs.
                    The SMEs were a big help in understanding stakeholder motivation.
                    Most of them had been an Executive or Director at a local
                    service center, so they were actual managers
                    and executives we could interview. They confirmed
                    that agency managers were concerned about wait times.
                    They were sensitive to state legislators' and
                    the public's criticism of poor service and delays.
                    They wanted software to help their staff work faster while
                    not making mistakes. Agency management wanted to
                    reduce workload on agency staff by pushing some
                    applicantion processing tasks directly
                    to the applicant via online services. As one SME said,
                    &quot;Budgets for
                    personnel at governments agencies never seem to cover
                    all the staff that is needed to handle the workload.&quot;</p>
            </div>

        <aside class="sidebarComments">
            <div >
                <p>
                    Because quantitative data showed two major demographic
                    groups for the general population of applicants,
                    one for Millenials and one for Gen-X-ers, we
                    developed personas to represent each group. We developed
                    a persona for Sylvia - Nurse Applicant, a 23-year-
                    old millenial and Frank - Small Business Owner, a
                    52-year-old Gen-X-er. The persona for Frank - Small
                    Business Owner is shown.

            <h3>Yet More Personas</h3>
            <p>Our ethnogrphic research led to more surprises. Only by talking with
                agency staff did we learn that one of the responsibilities
                of agency supervisors was the job of uploading the
                processed applications at the end of the day.
                This job function was not identified in the original system
                documents, but it turned out to be key in understanding MorphoTrust's
                business model and the larger scope of the software.</p>

            <p>When agency staff finish processing an applicantion,
                the application and supporting documentation are sent to a temporary
                storage area. At the end of each day, the MorphoTrust software bundles these
                completed applications and sends them to an evaluation server that
                determines which MorphoTrust production plant will receive applications
                for producion.</p>

            <p>We knew that MorphoTrust had credential production plants, but
                we did not know that MorphoTrust identity software sold to agencies
                included (rudimentary) features for sending processed applications
                to the production plants. Because software to produce
                the credentials was a separate product in the
                MorphoTrust existing product line, the BAs had not
                included it in the systems documentation for the new
                platform.  In fact, the uploading software was a small
                utility. It was easy to overlook. Only by talking with
                several supervisors on site did we realize the significance
                of the uploading utility.</p>

            <h3>More Pain Points</h3>

            <p>The upload process was not completely automated,
                but was initiated manually by an agency supervior. As we
                discovered from talking with supervisors, this
                semi-automated data upload resulted in occasional
                communication issues, either on the agency end or on the MorphoTrust
                processing server. Agency servers were usually run on old
                computers and networking services periodically malfunctioned.
                We learned from talking to the dev team that MorphoTrust
                did not have automatic error detection in the upload utility
                and there were limited error detection features in the
                receiving server software. This information led
                us to develop a persona for the  Agency Supervisor
                and the MorphoTrust System Admin. We wrote scenarios
                that innovated ways for lost communications
                to be detected, reported, and fixed.
            </p>


            <h3>Yet More Personas.</h3>

            <p>The issues produced by the occasional communication failures between the
                Agecny and production plants had grave consequences. By contract
                MorphoTrust had from one to four days to produce a
                credential and mail it to the applicant. If MorphoTrust did not
                produce the credential and mail it in the specified time, financial penalties
                ensued.<p>

                <p>MorphTrust maintained a dedicated agency Account Manager
                whose job was to monitor the the agency and any issues the
                agency was having with MorphoTrust software, including the upload process.
                The Account Manager was also responsible for monitoring the
                production of credentials at the production plants on behalf of
                the agency. It was the job of the Account Manager to
                communicate to the agency and to the VP of Plant Operations any
                issues.  The VP of Plant Operations's job was to re-route
                credential production to other plants if there were a
                production delay. The Account Manager maintained staff for
               tech support and fixing system issues. </p>

                <p>However, because no errors were detected and no alerts
                    sent, the Account Manager did not always know there
                    was a problem. By talking with Account Managers we found
                    that they had manual and ad hoc processes for detecting issues.
                    For instance they would run a processing report, which showed that
                    credential production had stopped. They could then investigate
                    further to find the problem and fit it. But this approach
                    relied on the Account Manager to suspect a problem and
                    manually run the report.</p>

                <p>By this point in the project, the deveopment team and
                    product management were aware of some of the issues
                    the Account Manager faced. Like us, they saw a need for the
                    Account Manager, the Plant Manager, and
                    MorphoTrust executives to be users of the new
                    system. We developed personas and scenarios for
                    these key uers, which led to additional innovations. One
                    of the solutions we proposed was a Dashboard for each key
                    user in the system. The Dashboard provided status
                    information and alerts for all key job tasks,
                    which provided users a single place to monitor their work.
                    MorphoTrust Account Managers were provided access permission to view
                    the dashboards of key agency staff. </p>

                    broke the  the personas out by
                    groups, based on the organization or company the
                    persona worked for. The groups broadly aligned with the
                    modules on which the proposed new system was built.

               <h3>Final Personas for the Issuance360 Platform</h3>
            <p>In the end, the MorphoTrust platform turned out to have a
                    complex set of personas.</p>

            <img class="article" src="images/Issuance360_personas.png">

                <p>We grouped the persons based
                    on the company or ogranization, which made it easier
                    to consider the group as a self-contained unit and to
                    design sytem features dedicated to the needs of the
                    personas within the group, without reference
                    to other groups. By using the groups as a whole, we
                    could think about the relationships between the groups
                    and design features to support these relationships. f
