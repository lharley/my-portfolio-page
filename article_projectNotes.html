            <h3>Research for Portfolio</h3>
            <p>Every year or so, I update my portfolio. For these updates, I do
                research. UX portfolios have evolved over the years, and trends change.
                What's changed in the last few years is the popularity of extensive
                case histories. The current trend is to document in great detail the
                history of the project, from the research conducted and the methods
                used, to the findings, personas, wireframes, and usability tests,
                to the problems and complexities encountered. Each step in the
                process and the supporting UX artifacts are provided in detail. The
                outcome shows how the UX designer's solutions solve the issues. These
                types of portfolios never fail to win accolades from the "best of UX lists."</p>

                <p>Experienced UX hiring managers can view an UX
                    design artifact to evaluate the designer's skill and knowledge.
                    A single design artifact doesn't violate my agreements.
                    It can "speak for itself" to my skill and experience.</p>

            <h3>What’s Wrong with Case Histories?</h3>
            <p>While the case history approach shows the designer's understanding of the
                UX process, the case histories praised by the best portfolio sites are very
                long and detailed -- too long and detailed. To me these case histories are best for new
                designers, who need to demonstrate basic understaning. For a very experienced
                designer, the approach is not ideal. First,  the approach violates a basic
                rule of the Web. Web users don't read, especially if content is long and
                technical. Second, much of my work represents confidential projects for
                internal use by the companies I have worked for. I've signed agreements
                NOT to share. Long, detailed case histories presented  on a public portfolio
                site violate my agreements. Most importantly, long case histories are
                difficult to prepare and even more difficult to modify and change. If you
                have a great many complex project examples, and you want to constantly
                show new recent work, the case history is just not a feasible approach.</p>

            <p>I am a senior designer, with a long history of work across multiple
                industries and disciplines. One of my strengths is my extensive experience.
                I want a portfolio that shows the breadth of my abilities. I recognize
                that the trend currently is to include more depth about the process and
                problems of each project, but I need another way to show my expertise
                besides a complete case history. I need a portfolio that is easy is
                to implement and adapt for prospective employers.

                <p>Cognitive psychology and learning theory describe how people learn
                    and absorb, and ultimately understand, information. People learn
                    best when they move up and down a macro-view and a micro-view of
                    the information space. At the macro-level is a overview or symbolic name. At
                    the lower levels discrete detailed information is associated to other
                    discrete information in a relationship of information that forms a
                    domain. This model explains why discrete
                    disclosure and hypermedia work well for new learners. The associated
                    information mirros the way human beings naturally absorb information.</p>

            <h3>Portfolio Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>The result of my UX portfolio research tells me that I need a portfolio
                that addresses the current  trend toward case histories, so I need to
                include more depth and detail about my work projects, but  I need a
                portfolio that faithfully adheres to the restrictions of my agreements
                and reflects my view that content needs to be structured to invite the
                user in — if the content is long and intimidating, and users don’t read
                the full case history, important information about my work may get missed.
            </p>

            <img src="images/content_levels.png" height="356" width="589"/>
            <h3>Design Solution</h3>
               <p> As a solution for the problem statement, I defined a 3-level content
                   approach. At the first level I show a set of tiles or cards, each of
                   which shows a visual and a brief description of a project. This allows
                   me to show the breadth of my experience without a lot of text and I
                   can easily a prepare an example. As the user hovers over a tile, an
                   overlay slider displays inviting the viewer to explore more. I added
                   this slider overlay, because feedback told me that users were missing
                   the links to working prototypes and storyboards I had placed on the
                   tiles previously. I needed to stress that there was more to each tile,
                   so I implemented a CSS slider animation to draw the user's attention.
                   The user clicks a tile to view the second content level: there is a
                   larger image, where the user can read the text and see detail,  there
                   is more text content about the project, and there are links to short
                   case histories, flow diagrams, working prototypes or other UX artifacts.
                   The links provide access to the third level of content, where the user
                   can explore actual project files or try out a demo. The design allows
                   the user to browse projects and interact with the ones that really
                   interest them. Long content only displays if the user chooses to view it.</p>

                <p>An additional advantage of the 3-level approach is that it allows
                    me to implement each project example independently. I can put up
                    a tile example quickly, then over time I can flesh out links to
                    case histories, flow diagrams, demos, or wireframes, as appropriate.</p>

                All the 1st and 2nd level content for an example is written in the HTML for the
                    tile. Simple jQuery + JavaScript hides the 2nd level content not intended for
                    the 1st level. A generalized jQuery click event adds listeners to all tiles,
                    so that when a user clicks a tile, "this" is passed to the routine
                    with the element's specific object ID. Using generalized event listeners eliminates
                    the need to use HTML ID's, which reduces the number of lines of code and
                    greatly reduces complexity. The routine then copies the hidden content
                    from the 1st level tile to the 2nd level popup pane.

            <p style="margin-top: 410px;">
                The majority of display adaptations are required for the smaller phone screens.
                For small screens, the introductory content is restricted to a few lines, so the
                user can see the example project tiles '' above the fold.' A More Button
                reveals the full content when the user clicks the button. JavaScript adds and removes
                div#fader and a#moreBtn styles to accomplish the dynamic display of content.

            <h3>Coding Objectives</h3>
            <p>One goal of my coding approach was to make the project examples interactive
                but not require custom JavaScript coding each time I added  a new project
                example or edited one. To this end I relied soley on simple CSS for the
                the overlay animations and transitions for the  portfolio "tiles" (rather
                than using JavaScript). I defined a popup pane template that used CSS
                to style the second level content and then used basic jQuery's powerfull
                CSS selectors to parse hidden content in the "tiles" and copy this content
                to the popup pane. This way the popup pane could be customized to reflect
                the tile that the viewer clicked on with a minimal coding.  The approach
                allowed me to focus on writing HTML content instead of JavaScript. The
                approach allowd me to place all the content for an example together in
                the HTML for the "tile," which  facilitatied content consistency, editing, proofing.
            </p>
             <img class="article" src="images/portfolio_coding_example_gray.png">
            <p>Another goal of the coding was to demostrate responsive coding skills.
                The page was coded as a ingle page using HTML and CSS3 Grid and Flexbox
                technologies. This reduced the lines of code and simplified the implementation
                (compared to the older CSS Float approach I had used previously).  Using media
                queries I easily modified the page for different screen resolutions,
                targetting smartphones and tablets. Rather than using a strict "mobile
                first" approach, I worked on the Web, tablet and smartphone displays
                together, modifying each to achieve the best display on each target
                resolution.  An important, related coding goal was to show that it is
                possible to implement engaging, interactive, and responsive Web  pages
                without the use of complicated frameworks and minimal JS coding. <br /><br />
                </p>
                 <img class="article" src="images/portfolio_CSS_example1.png">
                <p>A final comment is that my portfolio was designed, written, and
                coded by me, without help from anyone or use of templates, plug-ins,
                or JS libraries other than jQuery.</p>

                <h3>Software Tools Used for Portfolio Page</h3>
                <p>Tools used include Photoshop, Illustrator, Adobe XD, Acrobat,
                    Sketch, OmniGraffle, Mircosoft PowerPoint and Word. All artwork was
                    designed and created by me, with the use of some open-source stock photograpy.
                    The IDE used was JetBrains WebStorm. The JavaScript was hand-code.
                    All the UX artifacts and design examples represent only work that
                    I did, without contributions of co-workers or collaborators. Google
                    Chrome DevTools was used for development, testing and debugging.</p>
